# Python Version Installer

This script automates the installation of a specific Python version using Homebrew on macOS. It checks if Homebrew is installed and installs it if necessary. Then, it installs the specified Python version using Homebrew.

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `install_python.sh`).

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

3. Make the script executable by running the following command:
   ```
   chmod +x install_python.sh
   ```

4. Run the script with the desired Python version as a command line argument. For example, to install Python 3.9, run:
   ```
   ./install_python.sh 3.9
   ```

5. If Homebrew is not installed, the script will prompt you for your password to install it. Enter your password when prompted.

6. The script will install Homebrew (if necessary) and the specified Python version.

7. Once the installation is complete, you will see a message indicating that the script execution is completed.

## Requirements

- macOS
- Homebrew (if not already installed)

## Notes

- The script requires sudo access to install Homebrew on macOS.
- If Homebrew is already installed, the script will skip the Homebrew installation step.
- If the specified Python version is already installed, the script will skip the Python installation step.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please ensure that:
- You have a stable internet connection.
- You have provided the correct Python version as a command line argument.
- You have entered your password correctly when prompted.

If the issue persists, please refer to the Homebrew documentation or seek further assistance.
